# Object-Classification/Localization
A simple object classification/localization project in Keras

This is an approach to a simple object classification/localization problem, consisting of three classes of objects: Cucumbers, Eggplants and Mushrooms.

## Data
The data used are provided by Muhammed Buyukkinaci (https://github.com/MuhammedBuyukkinaci/Object-Classification-and-Localization-with-TensorFlow)


## Restrictions
Because for the purpose of this project Google Colab was used, it is quite limiting to the GPU and RAM provided, thus it is not possible to try and experiment more complicated architectures.
